# Choosing Algorithms

## What is an Algorithm 
- A well-defined "computational procedure"
    - A "computational procude" is anything that uses steps to perform
- Has an input and output

## How to Deterimine Which Algorithm to Use
- The best algorithm fits in the requirnments you have
    - least amount of time
        - if speed is a concern
        - the time concerns the worst case time
            - worst case = the input which the algorithm has the most steps to solve and takes the longest time for
    - How the algorithm scales
        - How it does with a range of input sizes
    - Memory Space
        - If you want the program to use the least amount of space in memory

## Determining the Theoretical Best Algorithm
- Theoretically Best Algorithm = The Algorithm that scales the best with the largest input size
    - May not be practical as the theoretical best may only be good for input sizes that are not seen in a practical use
